            <strong>Who am i?</strong> <br>
            as for now i am wade, i only tell close people 
            my actual name(mostly).
            <br>
            you probably either met me through userphone,c.c,p.c and etc.
            if you did, i'm glad that ur reading this. glad to every
            one of the viewer visiting my website when they clearly no need to.<br>
            now for most important question:<br>
            <strong>Why am i doing all this?</strong> <br>
            i just wish to help people in any way i can so they also
            don't go through what i went through here and there AND 
            actually guide people to use their pain and experience 
            as a lesson and not as guilt that stays forever.
            it all depends on the correct perspective.
            i want to  be a kind,hopeful and helpful person for those who are struggling.
            Basically i want to be what's called: <br> 
            <strong><em>Altruistic,Benevolent,Humane,Magnanimous</em></strong> <br>
            what does that stand for? just google urself lol <br>
            please note that i am not self glazing myself or anything, i just want
            to state my facts and my good intentions.
