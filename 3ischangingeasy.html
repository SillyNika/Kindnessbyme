            Changing is very hard. It takes lots of effort and time, it also
            depends on what you have commited.
            i said changing is hard, but it's possible and very necesarry.<br>
            <strong>"But what if i don't want to change wade?"</strong><br>
               Of course, some just don't feel like they don't need to change
               because why? why even do it? what's the point?<br>
               almost everything is the point, ur life will change a LOT
               and i believe in a good way. you will feel much more in life.
               but more importantly, you changing will help others around you.
               don't focus on "i experienced this and i'm sad". Yes,you need
               comfort. and you will achieve it.<br>
               and during the process, instead of thinking: <br>
            <strong>i experienced this and i'm sad.</strong><br>
            think about this:<br>
            <strong>i experienced this, but there is no need 
                for others to experience it also.
            </strong> <br>
            i believe anyone can do it, always put others before yourself 
            and try to guide them from what you learned from ur pain and
            experience.<br>
            <strong>Because of you, many can be saved/helped. always remember
                that in ur mind.
            </strong>
