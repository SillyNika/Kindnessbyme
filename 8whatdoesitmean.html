        <p class="intro">
    "Wade what does it mean to be a human?"
    <br> that is a very hard question and the answer
    is very complex. In my opinion, being a human means being 
    able to feel, to live, to explore, to feel joy/pain, regret, sorrow,
    being able to cry,being able to smile. the chance of 
    you living is so rare that you even being alive for a day
    is a huge blessing,that's why a day should be spend wisely.
    i try to spend my day wisely, trying to not miss out on 
    anything-while at the same time being hardworking and not lazy.
    <br> a Person's life,dreams,body,emotions, everything
    is so complex and so much stuff is in harmony that it's 
    simply so amazing and beautiful. and that's just one part 
    of humanity.
    <br>also, most importantly, <strong>it is 
        VERY Human for a person to fail, but to get 
        back up and keep going, even if it's hard or 
        "impossible."
    </strong> <br>
    Yes, there is pain in this world,yes, there is pain
    which comes from humanity, but there is also joy and hope 
    which comes from humanity simultaniously. That's how
    the world is-some call it unfair, some call it fair, 
    either way, it's the harsh truth. so instead of worrying 
    about it, a human should try to <strong>Live</strong>
    and not just <strong>survive.</strong> <br>
    that's exactly what that one penguin did, he saw the 
    Mountains as his true home, he kept
    searching  and going for it,we should do the 
    same thing, <strong>Humans need to live</strong>. he 
    was different, so we should also try to be different.
    <br>"but wade,that's just a damn penguin!" 
    <br> a penguin showed what it means to actually live,
    and to enjoy life, because he had one life only, so instead 
    of just surviving and surviving, he lived that life. <br>
    if a penguin is able to show this much stuff, imagine 
    how much we,humans,superior beings, can show other people 
    to what it means to be able to live and to not be 
    "stuck" and "worry" about surviving only.
    <strong>But this doesn't mean we should 
        be careless.
