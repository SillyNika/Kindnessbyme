            my site isn't anything special for most people,<br>
            but it's still to help those in need.<br>
            some can't fully explain some stuff to others<br>
            and that is perfectly okay<br>
            i understand how that feels, but i believe that can change. <br>
            i believe a person can change for the greater good.
