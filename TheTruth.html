            you may ask:<br>
            <strong>
                wade what's this?
            </strong> <br>
        it's something that may not 
        fully be connected to my website,
        but it's still to give people hope.
        bassicaly it's about <strong>My story.
        </strong> <br>
        i believe not many people have good stories
        (by stories,i mean backstory of people's lifes.)
        same goes for me.sure, i wish to help people, BUT
        this doesn't mean i haven't went into 
        pain or that kind
        of stuff. i have suffered like any human
        did here and there but that doesn't mean i should
        stop doing what i'm supposed to do. and i still believe
        because of my backstory, i'm not deserved to be called
        a <br> <strong>Good human.</strong> <br>
        anyways to put it shortly i wish to tell you about
        my backstory. <br>
        "okay wade we get it, what's ur backstory?"
        of course due to private reasons i won't of course tell 
        Everything here, but i still wanna say most stuff.
        my backstory goes something like this:
        When i was little i don't remember lots of stuff, i mostly
        spend my time around my friends in the 
        place where i live in, we had lots of fun 
        here and there but to put it shortly i don't 
        remember lots of stuff. besides all that, 
        when i was about 11-12 i sadly had a very HUGE
        problem. i kept overthinking and overthinking about
        lots of stuff."did that need to happen?"" 
        why did that happen?" " why didn't i do anything?
        " 
        "why am i so weak?" <br>
        most of the times it was nothing serious but i kept
        overthinking and overthinking and even if it was 
        a simple joke i just didn't really wanted to
        talk to specific people anymore, because every day
        for 2-3 years just felt so painful for me every
        single day and i wanted to change something.
        but that of course wasn't easy. nothing huge was going on
        in my life, just pure pain for years.
        <br> <strong>but that thankfully changed,
        </strong>
        i decided to get discord and try to meet new people, new friends
        try to just be happy for once properly. did that work?  first attempt
        of course not, i failed and i didn't meet 
        a good person. but later on i learned from that and realised 
        my mistake (that i wish to not say here) and later on
        i met more people who turned out to be normal and i hang out with them
        a ton, i was starting to feel so happy and a bit normal.
        but they were simple friends, we weren't too close. i wanted
        someone to be REALLY close with and actually trust.
        but sadly, that did not go so well. i sadly, while Also 
        making my own mistakes, put trust into lots of
        people who sadly ruined it for me and later 
        on the consequences straight up hit,
         or i did something dumb and
         the person who was close to my heart left me.
        either way it didn't go well. but i never gave up,
        and i looked for a proper person, also at the same time i was looking
        for new friends. i met lot's of people, some 
        broke my trust, some gained my trust, 
        but most of them Left.i lost many people who were 
        close to me, and many friends sadly. <br>
        but i gained new ones at the same time,i also gained
        VERY trusted people, again, i felt happy, but i also 
        had despair. <br>
        but also meanwhile in this process, i found Christ,Christianity
        meant a TON to me. i started to read the bible, research about it
        again and again, told my friends- "don't do this,
        it's a sin!" or i told them- "seek Christ."
        i will explain that more later on, but i kind of "abandoned
        " Christianity in about 2025. <br>
        anyways, in around 2024 like i said, meet new people,
        lose people, etc. but in around the start of 
        2024, i met 3 very good people, i won't, of course say 
        their full names, but their names were something like- 
        N,M,T. they were like "the big three." i talked to them
        almost every day. They gained my trust and i 
        have contact with two of them,yes, sadly i don't 
        and can't have contact with one because of what i did.
        even so, in 2024 and even later on, they were still 
        my close friends and they helped me out SO Much, they always
        put a smile on my face. <br>
        and also in 2024 january-ish i met a special person,
        i thought they were nice, and they slowly gained my 
        trust, but it did not end good. <strong>why?</strong>
        i also asked my self that but i sadly learned out why 
        a very hard way. our dms were getting screenshotted and 
        i believed i got "played" with, like a toy. even so,
        (while growing with Christ) i still forgave her and 
        later on moved on. also in january i stopped swearing. <br>
        2024 june- thought i had a very close friend, but 
        i lost her also, due to some stuff. we were having LOTS 
        of fun, but it is,again,okay. <br>
        2024 july- met a new special person. it was summer, school 
        ended. i thought to myself: "no more school 
        for now! i can spend more time with her!"
        <br> <strong>but what happend?</strong> <br>
        same ending once more, but we had to let it go 
        due to personal reasons. it's okay, it didn't really last long.
        (i kept repeating that to 
        myself, and it was the truth.) <br>
        during summer, i started to read the bible, the new 
        tastement, i finished the new tastement in seqtember.
        i absolutely loved it, pure wisdom shown in one book.
        so i started to get to closer to Christ even more.
        after summer ended,school started and thankfully 
        the overthinking was slowly stopping.
         i felt 
        happy, i was improving here and there. But i still 
        had this one problem i was trying to get rid of for years.
        i thought it was impossible, but i kept telling myself no, there is
        hope.(it wasn't overthinking, it was something else).
        later on i told to myself: <br> <strong>
        "hey, i'm having this problem, but 
        i believe proper love can fix 
        what i'm going through! i only
        need to find love! that is the 
        answer and my solution to my problems."</strong><br>
        and once more- a new special person.
        and my theory was correct! love fixed my problem.
        but this time, the time with that special person 
        felt so different, i actually felt happy and 
        it actually felt like it was gonna last, 
        the special person actually changed my perspective 
        of the world. even after everything i experiences to
        this day, this was still the one of the most wholesome 
        things i have ever went through and i will never forget 
        about it. <br>
        but even after all this, it still had to end because 
        of again another private reason that i can't tell here. 
        but it was okay. i started to learn from 
        everything i have faced and i started to learn 
        from people here and there. <br>
        but at the same time, when i lost that special
        person,something else was going on. sadly 
        there were protests in the capital of the 
        country that i live in. there were protests 
        and protests everyday, but the thing it
        they weren't regural. people got hurt
        on screen and i just felt so sad and depressed
        that my people were getting hurt, it hit me 
        in a way that i just didn't even experience before.
        that combined with losing that person- just sucked.
        i felt very,very depressed. <br>
        but later on, of course, that changed. 2024 ended 
        and 2025 started. 2025 just like 2024 was a 
        coo coo crazy year. lot's of stuff happend here 
        and there. <br>
        Around january-may nothing huge was happening for me,
        everything was simply going quietly, but i was still 
        making new friends here and there.
        but in June, i left christianity-ish, i simply 
        just didn't believe it anymore, i sadly lost 
        something that was dear to my heart, that was
        my life and my everything. yes i lost my life,
        but i gained a new one and i am very glad about 
        that also. i was happy that my hope could be 
        used in another way also.  
         <br>
        but any special person? <br> for that time,no.
        but i thought that also changed. i thought 
        i found a person again, a specia person in the summer.
        i in the summer also went to gym, started making my
        other website, life was going very great. but of course 
        things don't last forever. sadly due to my mistake 
        i lost that special person,yes, it could have been avoided 
        but i did something very stupid that i wish to not 
        repeat ever again. i did and will learn about my
        mistakes. besides all that, nothing huge happend.
        school ended-seqtember came. in seqtember, i actually thought 
        i had two special people-ish. the first one i met well sadly 
        simply didn't choose me and that's okay, we are still 
        friends, i do not blame her. the other one lied 
        about something so i left all that. besides that i thought 
        i had a good friend, a very good friend, whom sadly 
        blocked me. but that's also okay, seqtember did suck, 
        school started also, but i started seeing my 
        homies more and life got better-<strong>even if it looked 
            like it was gonna be a hard month. <br>
            in octomber-november i met a very good person 
            named rei. rei has been by my side for a long 
            time and he is very special in my heart.
        </strong> <br>
         nothing huge was happening UNTIL december. something 
         very crazy hit my life like never before, something that 
         seemed great, yet turned out be disasterous. first, i met 
         this one girl, one very special girl, who i loved 
         a ton. i showed her more stuff and shared more information 
         about me. i told her what kind of backstory i had, 
         what i sadly was like,and how horrible my full backstory 
         was. she still accepted me  and we became lovers. 
         she seemed almost exactly like me, i even felt 
         she was my soulmate, i loved her a ton. but,sadly, 
         even that changed also. i still lost her when i tried 
         Not to. i sadly did most things, but she didn't do that.
         it hurt, it hurt so bad. besides her a very hard and 
         harsh truth hit my thoughts. i was about to give up and 
         Just do what my bad thoughts toldme to do, but i didn't do
         that. because of my brother and a very,very close friend,
         friend of friends, homie's of homies,The curse of the 
         curses. one of the reason i'm able to write this 
         is because of him, he saved me and changed my whole 
         perspective. because of him, even when i went through 
         so much dark stuff, he still stayed by my side and 
         helped me out. now i am happy, sometimes, even when 
         i miss that girl,even if she hurt me and some stuff 
         simply went too bad, i still wish to live, because 
         being able to feel means that i'm  a human, however, 
         i will not be stuck in depression, so i got out of it.
         Now, start of 2026, i met a very good person already. 
         she is dear to my heart, she is a very good friend. and not 
         Only that, many friends, who i know from 2024-2025 still 
         remained and didn't dissapear, all of them have very 
         special places in my heart and i will never,NEVER forget 
         about them.
         <br>
         this is it for now, i may add more stuff as life goes 
         On,of course, i won't add absolutely everything personal.
         but i will try my best to add more stuff.
         This is my story,for now.
