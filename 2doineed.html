            like i said, changing is hard, but necesarry.
            it may not always be needed if you didn't went through any bad
            stuff or if you think ur not a bad person<strong>(this may not be 
                true,depends on ur actions that you have commited.)
            </strong><br>
            change is important for helping other people and also for growth.
            by you changing in a better person, you can help others also.<br>
            <strong>"but wade, how can i even help others when i 
            can't even help myself?"<br></strong>
            i also understand that part.i also myself felt many times where i thought
            i had no help whatsoever.<br>
            but i was wrong.i decided to open up trusted people more and more
            and they helped a lot and helped me go through lots of stuff.<br>
            my advice here is that-open up to VERY trusted people,if 
            you are able to.<br>
            <strong>"But wade, i have no one, 
                or i feel like i have no one."<br></strong>
            if you ever feel like you have no one, 
            of course i advice to meet 
            new people and trusted people, but i believe not 
            many are going to do this.
            so this is exactly why i wish for you 
            to contact me in any way you can and we 
            can talk it out.<br>
            <strong>"okay wade why would i even trust you?"<br></strong>
            you have no reason to trust me 
            whatsoever,but all i wish for you is to help 
            you no matter what happens because i believe 
            that's what it means to be human.<br>
            <strong>"what if you tell others my information?"<br></strong>
            i will not because there is no reason to.
            i have talked to trusted people about my problems 
            and they didn't tell it 
            to anyone. so why would i?
