            changing itself is very hard to do,<br>

            and not many people wish to change.

            but changing, in my opinion,<br> is very very important.

            however there are still times where a person just wishes to

            not change and simply wants to rest.<br>

            i completely understand that, and i believe rest should be

            given.<br>

            but after resting a person must change

            even if it's slow and takes time.<br>

            <strong>"but wade, why change? why can't i remain in my hole

            forever?"<br></strong>

            you can stay in the hole, but loneliness may come,

            but more importantly, you need to say to urself that<br>

            there are people who were like you or who were(or are) going through

            the same stuff as you and thefereforeth you should use ur pain 

            and learn from what happend and help someone who's in need.<br>

            do you want to someone else go through something that you went

            through? i hope the answer is no.<br>

            <strong>also changing is necessary if you think you

                went thought some bad stuff or if you think you do need help with

                something.(find out more about this in do i need to change paragpraph.)
